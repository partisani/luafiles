amber light wavelength taken from the phosphor wikipedia article
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphor#Standard_phosphor_types)
and converted to a hex code (inaccurately and as an approximation)
by https://academo.org/demos/wavelength-to-colour-relationship/.

more color info was taken from the cool-retro-term terminal emulator
(https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term, really cool btw).
